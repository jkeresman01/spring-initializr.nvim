## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome. You can help by:

- Picking up an existing issue.
- Opening a new **bug report** or **feature request** with clear details.
- Submitting a focused pull request that improves code, docs, or UX.

### How to get started
1. Fork the repo and clone your fork.
2. Create a topic branch: `git checkout -b feature/<short-name>` or `fix/<short-name>`.
3. Develop and test locally in Neovim:
   - Ensure dependencies are installed: `plenary.nvim`, `nui.nvim`, `telescope.nvim`.
   - Load the plugin and verify `:SpringInitializr` and `:SpringGenerateProject`.
4. Commit with clear messages and reference any related issues:  
   `git commit -m "Add toggle for X (#123)"`
5. Push and open a pull request against `main`.

### Filing issues
- Use the provided issue templates for bugs and features.
- For bugs, include Steps to Reproduce, Actual vs Expected Behavior, Environment, and logs if available.
- For features, describe the motivation, proposed solution, and alternatives considered.

If you are unsure where to start, open an issue to discuss an idea before coding.
